Hello, I am **Nazeh**, and I am a Frontend developer, designer, and creative coder.

I have always been fascinated by Softwareâ€™s potentials as a visual designer. So I learned web development by building multiple web-apps.

I can **speak** the language of both **designers** and **developers**.

Currently, I am looking for a position as a front-end engineer, joining an experienced team and contribute to building great products.
