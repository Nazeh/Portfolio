Hello, I am Nazeh, and I am an Architect, a 3d Artist, and a web developer.

I have always been fascinated by Softwareâ€™s potentials as a visual designer. So I learned full-stack development by building multiple web-apps.

I can speak the language of both designers and developers.

Currently, I am looking for a position as a front-end developer joining an experienced team and contribute to building great products.
