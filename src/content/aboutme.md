Iâ€™m <span>Nazeh</span> , a self-taught <span>web developer</span>.

After my college degree in "Architectural Engineering", I worked as a 3d Artist where I designed and created characters for 3d printing, and game development.

I have always been a big fan of SIGGRAPH and watching closely how software development is disrupting the assets creation pipeline, and I finally decided to take the leap and be a developer.

Since June 2019 I started studying web development full-time, building collaborative projects with pair programming and practicing problem-solving daily.
